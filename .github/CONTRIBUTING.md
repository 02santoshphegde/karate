# Contribution guidelines

First of all, thanks for thinking of contributing to this project. :smile:

- Before sending a Pull Request, please make sure that you're assigned the  GitHub issue.
    - If a relevant issue already exists, discuss on the issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.
    - If no relevant issue exists, open a new issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.

    Please proceed with a Pull Request only after you're assigned. It'd be sad if your Pull Request (and your hardwork) isn't accepted just because it isn't ideologically compatible.
